# CS112-Git-Interface
Python file to allow CS112 students to use git safely

CS112 is an introductory computer science class taught at George Mason University using python. 
Since many CS112 students are taking this class in their first semester of college, it is likely that this is their first exposure to programming. 
Additionally, they are probably overwhelmed with the adjustment to college life and classes. 
As such, I would like to enable my students to instantly use version control to track their work in a simple, easy, effective manner.

### How to Use the File:
1. Put `git.py` into your working directory.
2. Run the command `python3 git.py` if you are using MacOS terminal or `python git.py` if you are using Windows command prompt.
3. Initialize the git repository by using option `1`
