# CS112-Git-Interface
Python file to allow CS112 students to use git safely

CS112 is an introductory computer science class taught at George Mason University using python. </br>
Since many CS112 students are taking this class in their first semester of college, it is likely that this is their first exposure to programming. </br>
Additionally, they are probably overwhelmed with the adjustment to college life and classes. </br>
Therefore, I would like to enable my students to instantly use version control to track their work in a simple, easy, effective manner. </br>
